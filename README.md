# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow for **Customer Segmentation**, a critical application in marketing analytics. By analyzing customer data, the model clusters customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors, preferences, and demographics. Such segmentation allows businesses to tailor strategies for better customer engagement and retention.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into data distribution, relationships, and patterns.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implements popular techniques like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses methods like PCA for feature reduction and visualization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses clustering results using metrics like silhouette score and inertia.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for the analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualizations.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:
- Customer ID
- Demographics (e.g., age, gender, income)
- Transaction history
- Behavioral data

> **Note**: Ensure that your dataset is uploaded in the same directory as the notebook.
